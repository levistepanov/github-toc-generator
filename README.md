# github-toc-generator
helps create a table of contents for Github sidebar

Usage: 
This was only tested/used in Chrome

1. Simply open the Developers console on the page you want to create a TOC for.
2. paste the code and run it.
3. copy the results to an editor (notepad++)
4. replace the chrome line numbers with "". There will be 2 different line numbers to remove, the top section line number and the bottom.
  i.e., replace "VM1726:22 " with ""
5. paste the result into your Github sidebar .md file.

Will add capitalization to the Link names soon.
